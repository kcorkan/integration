If this is the case, a security token will be needed to do POSTs or DELETES. \n Use the doPost function for any posts in this case.  Security tokens are generally obsolete except for when using On-premise or sandbox implementations of Agile Central where API keys are not available.  Security tokens are only needed for POST, PUT and DELETE commands.  Basic Authentication (see below) can be used for GET commands.",
